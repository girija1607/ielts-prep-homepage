## ## **Design Choices**

* **Color Palette:** The primary color is a deep **slate blue** to evoke a sense of trust and professionalism. This is contrasted with a vibrant **emerald green** for calls-to-action (like buttons) to draw user attention and suggest success. The overall background is a mix of white and light gray to maintain a clean and uncluttered feel.

* **Typography:** The **"Inter"** font family was chosen for its excellent readability and modern, neutral aesthetic, which works well for both headings and body text.

* **Responsiveness:** A **mobile-first** approach was taken. The layout is a single column on small screens for easy scrolling and expands into multi-column grids on larger screens to make effective use of the available space. Flexbox and Grid were used extensively to achieve this fluid layout.
